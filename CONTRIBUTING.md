We welcome surgical-grade optimizations. 

## Standards
* **No Comments:** Code must be cognitively designed and self-documenting. Avoid `#` lines as they can interfere with some terminal environments.
* **Precision:** Use mastered `sed` and `cat` operations for file manipulations.
* **Anonymity:** Ensure no personal identifiers are present in PRs.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/Optimization`).
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Open a Pull Request.
